# Todo-Backend-Development

In this project I have create REST API's for Todo project for absolute begineers.

Functionalities of this projects are: 
1. Register a user
2. Login
3. Update, delete, get, add todo task with proper title and description
4. User authentication

If u are making full stack todo web application, you can definitely use these apis just by integrating it to your frontend.

Thanks, I hope this would. For any assistance, u can mail me here krishnakapoor748@gmail.com
